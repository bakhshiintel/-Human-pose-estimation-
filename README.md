# -Human-pose-estimation-

Human Pose Estimation (HPE) is a way of identifying and classifying the joints in the human body. Essentially it is a way to capture a set of coordinates for each joint (arm, head, torso, etc.,) which is known as a key point that can describe a pose of a person. The connection between these points is known as a pair.

 In this project, a bottom-up approach for realtime multi-person pose estimation is used.For more details, see the CVPR'17 paper.https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08050
