# -Human-pose-estimation-

Human Pose Estimation (HPE) is a way of identifying and classifying the joints in the human body. Essentially it is a way to capture a set of coordinates for each joint (arm, head, torso, etc.,) which is known as a key point that can describe a pose of a person. The connection between these points is known as a pair.
